## Conclusion


> Data analysis was performed on "Heroes of Pymoli" data set (purchase_data.json, purchase_data2.json) and following observations were made:

----
### Trend 1:
Percentage of female buyers are way less than males. It may be a good idea to focus on activities in game that are targeted towards female audience 

| Gender Demographics   | Percentage of Players | Total Count | 
|-----------------------|-----------------------|-------------| 
| Female                | 17.45%                | 100         | 
| Male                  | 81.15%                | 465         | 
| Other / Non-Disclosed | 1.40%                 | 8           | 


----
### Trend 2:
Older people of 40+ age are not buying as much and its probably due to marketing towards one set of group. That strategy needs to be evaluated.
